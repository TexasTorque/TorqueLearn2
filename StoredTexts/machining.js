        "<p>Before replacing the plastic portions of the doors, it is necessary to remove the complete door assembly. On the two sets of front doors, this is done by removing the two 9/16 nuts holding each of the four doors to the I-bolt on the upper rail. For the side doors, the handle must be removed with a Phillips head screwdriver from the inside of the door. After the handle is removed, the doors can be slid out of the top of the machine. The plastic portions of the front doors can be removed using an 11mm socket and a Phillips head screwdriver.</p>",

        "<h3>Choosing and Cutting Material</h3>",
        "<p>1/8 inch polycarbonate should be used to replace the doors, as acrylic will crack. The old doors should be used as a template on the table saw to cut new doors at the same size.</p>",

        "<h3>Attaching New Plastic Portion</h3>",
        "<p>When attaching the plastic portion of the door, align the polycarbonate piece with the frame of the door. Use a 5/16in drill bit to drill holes in the polycarbonate using the frame to align. Holes for the handle on the side doors also need a 3/16in drill bit, as well as the handles on the front door.</p>",

        "<h3>Reattaching Doors</h3>",
        "<p>To reattach the doors, first align the I-bolts to the holes in the frame, then tighten the 9/16 nuts. The doors may need adjustment in either height or level to ride smoothly and mate correctly. This can be done by raising or lowering the top nut then loosening or tightening the bottom nut as necessary, until the correct height or level is achieved. The side doors will need to be lifted to the top of the machine to be reinserted. It may be necessary to have a second person help to align the doors with the interior tracks.</p>",

        "<h3>What is CNC machining?</h3>",

        "<p>CNC machining is a subtractive process (meaning material is removed) in which a spindle, that moves relative to the part that is being cut, spins an endmill that cuts away material from stock (the raw material) to achieve the desired geometry.</p>",

        "<h3>Why is CNC machining important?</h3>",

        "<p>CNC machining allows us to quickly make very accurate custom parts. Many custom parts are needed for the robot that we would have no way of purchasing. Without our CNC machines, we would be required to manually fabricate the parts, which would be very inaccurate and time inefficient, or purchase parts from a machine shop, which is often costly and slow.</p>",

        "<h3>How does the machine know what to do?</h3>",

        "<p>It doesn't. The CNC machine only follows the instructions we give it through a file type called Gcode. This Gcode is generated through software called CAM. As the CNC lacks knowledge of what it is doing, we must be careful when generating CAM and setting origins for the machine (telling it where to cut) to ensure the machine performs the desired actions and doesn't crash into the part or workpiece.</p>",
