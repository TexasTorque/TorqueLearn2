        "<p>In, we learned about a <i>feedback</i> controller. Feedback in this case refers to how the control system responds to error. This works most of the time, however, this is <i>reactive</i>, not <i>proactive</i>. For a PID to work, your system must have error to begin with; which isn't ideal.</p>",

        "<p>In contrast, a <i>feed forward</i> controller uses model information to instantly set the approximate desired state. This reduces error time, and it can help minimize oscillations by reducing the PID's importance in the system.</p>",

        "<h3>Why is in a Feed Forward Controller?</h3>",

        "<p>A normal feed forward controller takes in two to three values for the model: \\(k_s\\) for static application, \\(k_v\\) for velocity application, and (optionally for the most part) \\(k_a\\) for acceleration application.</p>",

        "<h4>What is a \\(k_s\\) term needed?</h4>",

        "<p>It is important for those implementing control systems to have a healthy understanding of physics. As such, this will not go in depth for the reason.</p>",

        "<p>In a nutshell, however, two connecting objects that contain a normal force exert a frictional force. There are two types of frictional forces, static and kinetic. Each type has its own coefficient of friction, Î¼. Static friction exists until a slipping point is reached, at which point kinetic friction takes over. This is due to intermolecular forces soft-binding objects at the subatomic level.</p>",

        "<p>For many applications of PID, you may have witnessed the error term existing but nothing happening. This is due to static friction: despite putting in energy, the static friction is preventing movement. The \\(k_s\\) term overcomes this by always keeping the model near or at the slipping point to provide fast changes in velocity.</p>",

        "<h3>Calculating feed forward values</h3>",

        "<li><b>Encoder value</b> - An encoder value is a measurement recorded using a real-life recording device. For example, an encoder on a wheel can record how many times it has revolved.</li>",
